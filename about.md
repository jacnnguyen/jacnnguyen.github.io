# About Me

I’m a technical writer with experience documenting complex, highly regulated software products. I work closely with engineering, product, and QA teams to translate technical complexity into usable, trustworthy documentation.

I thrive in Agile environments, enjoy learning new technologies, and focus on documentation that directly improves customer outcomes.

**Key strengths:**
- Customer-centered documentation
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Structured authoring and content reuse
- Docs-as-code workflows
